- **Integers**: Whole numbers and their negatives (...-2, -1, 0, 1, 2...)
- **Rational Numbers**: Numbers that can be expressed as a fraction (1/2, 0.75, -3/4)
- **Irrational Numbers**: Numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction (π, √2)
- **Real Numbers**: All rational and irrational numbers
- **Complex Numbers**: Numbers in the form a + bi (3 + 4i)
- **Imaginary Numbers**: Numbers in the form bi (4i)
